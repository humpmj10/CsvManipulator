# CsvManipulator
Small csv program created to test co pilot functionality and assistance.

I have never used swag or needed to use it, but copilot was able to assist me in creating the swag annotations, which
dependency to use and debug when it wasn't working correctly. I was able to create a csv file and read it in using suggested
dependencies and code that was generated. Overall it's a helpful tool that I will continue to use and learn from.

After the intial implemention I wanted to see how much chatGPT could help with a front end using vue.js. It
prompted me fairly well and was able to enhance the UI after the initial suggestions.
